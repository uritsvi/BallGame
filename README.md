# BallGame

A simple game I build in two weeks using the [C++ Fast-track for Games Programming](https://www.3dgep.com/cpp-fast-track-2-template)

<h2>How to play</h2>
- Use the A and D keys to move the ball forward or backwards
- Use the space button to jump
- to restart the game press the ```R``` button
- To See this manual press the ```H``` button
- Your goal is to touch the finish brick
